# Mission Impossible - Appx License

Let's be brief (HA!). This folder is intened to actually deploy Appx (or AppxBundle) into a custom Windows offline image, however, an offline license is needed too.

It's possible to use the well-known Microsoft Store for Business (or for Education). In fact, I tried by using an institutional account to accomplish that purpose, but it's pretty impossible due to missing permissions (even if it's a free app).

There are two alternatives: obtain those licenses through third-parties or create a "free tier" personal Azure AD admin account and use with Microsoft Store for Business. ~~For the moment, I'm only missing one license, and it's expected to be obtained with a recovery media from another Lenovo laptop.~~ DONE!

Despite this, there is an Appx license which it's pretty impossible to obtain, and this is "SynLenovoLBGD App". It's self-signed, not signed by Microsoft (and, as a consequence, not deployed on Microsoft's servers), and that's why the Azure alternative it's unattainable. To make matters worse, because of that self-signature, it's not recognized by any root certificate (bravo, Lenovo!), and adding a certificate to an offline image isn't available.

The last alternative is by using 'Audit Mode' through 'Sysprep' and do whatever I want, but let's be honest, I'm not a huge fan of this and it makes me very lazy, and that's why this folder is pure crap.
